                                    <p>Download the ReachNow App on your iOS or Android device and register with your current driver’s license and credit card. Follow the simple instructions and you could be approved and driving within minutes.</p>

                                    <h4>What are the requirements for membership?</h4>
                                    <p>To become a ReachNow Member, you must have a valid U.S. driver’s license, acceptable driving record including no major violations (see membership agreement for details) and be at least 18 years old, and have at least 2 years of driving experience. A valid credit or debit card is required in order to make payments. Prepaid credit cards are not accepted.</p>

                                    <p>No, you can utilize the full service with just the App. You can take your first trip as soon as you are approved using the ReachNow App. After registration, you will be asked to enter your mailing address in order to receive a Member Key card for all future trips. This Member Key card functions as the car key – it will lock and unlock any available vehicle in our city-wide fleet and is valuable to have in cases when you phone may have poor cellular reception.</p>

                                    <h4>What if I want a Member Key card immediately?</h4>
                                    <p>Member Key cars are mailed after you take your first trip. If you need one sooner, please call Member Support at (844) 732-2466 to expedite the process. Please know you can use your app to open a vehicle after you successfully register.</p>

                                    <p>ReachNow maintains the state-mandated insurance minimums.</p>

<ul>
	<li>In Washington state, we maintain $30,000 per person, $60,000 per accident and $10,000 in<br>
	property damage</li>
	<li>In Oregon, we maintain $25,000 per person, $50,000 per accident and $20,000 in property damage</li>
	<li>In New York state, we maintain $60,000 in combined single limit coverage. Members are responsible for a $500 insurance deductible if they are found at-fault in an accident</li>

                                    <h4>Can I see my car’s fuel level or state of charge before I pick it up?</h4>
                                    <p>Yes. You can view individual vehicle details including fuel level or state of charge in the ReachNow app. Before reserving a vehicle, check the fuel/charge level to ensure it suits the needs of your trip. Our fleet team works around the clock to make sure cars are adequately fueled and charged.</p>

                                    <h4>Do I need to refuel/recharge the car before I return it?</h4>
                                    <p>Members will be required to return a vehicle with at least 5 miles of fuel/charging capacity remaining – as calculated by the vehicle’s range computer while the vehicle is in its default drivetrain setting (i.e., comfort mode rather than Sport or Eco Pro for the BMW 3-Series). If the vehicles is returned with less than 5 miles of range, a $5 fuel surcharge may be assessed.</p>

                                    <p>Before reserving a vehicle, check the fuel/charge level to ensure it suits the needs of your trip. Members are responsible for additional fuel costs if the provided fuel is insufficient.</p>

                                    <h4>What do I have to keep in mind when driving electric?</h4>
                                    <p>The BMW i3 offers the same flexibility as the rest of the vehicles in our fleet, but there are some differences to be aware of if you have never driven an electric vehicle:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Silence:</strong> When you start the motor you will hear … nothing. Drivers should keep in mind that the absence of noise could mean pedestrians and cyclists may not hear the car approaching.</li>
	<li><strong>Range:</strong> Depending on factors such as your driving style, the topography of your route, or the outside temperature, for example, the total range of your trip will be up to 130 miles. That’s like a trip from downtown Seattle to Tacoma, and back. Always be aware of your state of charge. There are multiple ways to view how many miles remain on the current charge: 1) Press the button on the cruise control stick (left side of the steering wheel) until you see remaining miles displayed on the control panel; or 2) Use the iDrive Controller to find your state of charge under vehicle settings. The BMW i3 has three driving modes: Comfort, ECO PRO and ECO PRO+. ECO PRO and ECO PRO+ support an efficient driving style to conserve energy by reducing AC output and limiting acceleration and speed.</li>
	<li><strong>Regenerative Braking:</strong> The one-pedal control of the electric BMW eDrive system lets you brake using the accelerator pedal. If you take your foot off the accelerator, the innovative braking recuperation kicks in, the car slows down noticeably, and the brake lights illuminate. Drivers should keep this in mind when signaling other drivers. Once you’re familiar with pedal regeneration, you will find cruising through the city without pushing the brake very comfortable. Driving this way provides energy to the battery and helps to prolong the range of the vehicle. We strongly suggest that you use the brake pedal when you come to a complete stop, especially when you’re on an incline. Even though the car has an automatic transmission, keeping your foot on the brake pedal will ensure that you maintain your current position.</li>
	<li><strong>Charging:</strong> Don’t worry about charging. This is managed by our fleet team, so any BMW i3 available should have enough charge to cover all trips around the city during a day. The BMW i3 with Range Extender, included in the ReachNow fleet, greatly extends the range of the vehicle depending on driving habits and environmental conditions. The Range Extender adds a lightweight and efficient two-cylinder gasoline engine. When the initial charge is depleted to approximately 5 percent, the Range Extender automatically starts to maintain the battery’s state of charge. The engine only produces electricity to charge the battery.</li>
</ul>
                                </li>

                                    <h4>Do I have to use my Member Key card to lock the vehicle when I end my booking?</h4>
                                    <p>No. You can also use the Lock Car feature in the ReachNow app. However, we recommend you keep your Member Key with you in case there are connection problems.</p>

                                    <h4>How do I clear my Bluetooth information after a trip?</h4>
                                    <p>After every trip, each vehicle automatically resets and deletes any personally identifiable information such as your phone’s Bluetooth connection and any synched information.</p>

                                    <p>All of our vehicles have electronic owner’s manuals which are accessible via the in-car entertainment system. To pull up simply navigate to the BMW or MINI menu using the iDrive controller in the center console. Then choose ‘Vehicle Info’ and select ‘Owner’s Manual’.</p>

                                    <p>All of our vehicles have automatic transmissions. On the BMW i3, the gear shift and park button are behind the steering wheel, on the right-hand side. On the BMW 3-Series and MINI vehicles, the gear shift is in the center console.</p>

                                    <h4>How does Lost and Found work?</h4>
                                    <p>If you’ve lost something, please contact Member Support. If the vehicle is still available, we may reserve it so you can run back and grab your belongings. Please remember, we take no responsibility for your personal belongings, but we will do our best to help. We will hold lost and found items for 30 days.</p>

                                    <h4>What if my car is dirty?</h4>
                                    <p>When you rate your trip after the drive, indicate that the vehicle was dirty so we can be sure to clean it.</p>

                                    <h4>How do I adjust the seats?</h4>
                                    <p>BMW i3 and MINI vehicles: To move the front seat forward and back, use the lever under your thigh. To adjust the height and angle, use the lever on the side of the seat. BMW 3-Series and BMW X1 SAV: : Use the electronic controls on the side of the seat.</p>

                                    <h4>What should I do if I’m in an accident?</h4>
                                    <p>Call 911 immediately. There is an accident reporting brochure located in the glovebox of every vehicle. Review the instructions and be sure to fill out the form as accurately as possible. If another party was involved in the accident, be sure to provide the attached insurance cards to those parties. Notify Member Support at (844) 732-2466.</p>

                                    <h4>What should I do if I’m running out of energy when driving with the electric BMW i3?</h4>
                                    <ul>
	<li>Conserve energy.</li>
	<li>Know your remaining driving miles. ZERO means ZERO – the remaining mileage displayed on the screen is accurate, there is no reserve of energy.</li>
	<li>Find the nearest charging station.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can save energy by switching to EcoPro mode (press the EcoPro switch on the center console) and by driving more conservatively.</p>

<p>Press the button on the cruise control stick (left side of the steering wheel) until you see remaining miles displayed on the control panel. You can now determine the distance you can safely drive to the nearest charger. Find the nearest public charging location by using the in-car navigation or call Member Support at (844) 732-2466.</p>

                                    <p>Members are required to inspect the vehicle before their trip and report any damage via the app or by calling Member Support. Tap on a blue dot on the vehicle illustration to report new damage. Previously reported damage will be indicated by a yellow dot.
